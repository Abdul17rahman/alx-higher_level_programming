# 0x04-python-more-data-structures

In this section we cover more data structures in Python namely Sets and dictionaries as defined in the first section on data structures.
We also cover advanced concepts like lambda, map, filter and reduce.
Lambda - Is an anonymouse function in Python. It takes arguments and perform only a single expression. Lambda return a function object or simply a function.
Map - Map function is used to perform an operation on every single element of an iterable object in Python. Its similar to the map method in JavaScript.
Filter - It separates elements of an iterable based on a certain condition. Similar to map, filter takes a function and an iterable as arguments and its also similar to JavaScript filter method.
Reduce - This reduces the elements of an iterable to a single value by performing operations on them passed as the argument. Unlike map and filter, reduce doesnt return an iterable but rather returns a single value.
