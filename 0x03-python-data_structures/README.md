# 0x03-python-data-structures

Data structures is a way of structuring data in order to efficiently store, find, use and create data depending on the task at hand. This chapter introduces to the built-in data structures in Python namely Lists, Tuples, Sets and dictionaries.

List - Arrays in other languages is a ds that stores elements or items in a sequence (back to back).
Tuples - These are the same as lists but they are non-immutable (you cant modify them).
Sets - These are also the same as lists but they do not allow duplication.
Dictionaries - These are key-value pairs ds similar to hash tables or objects in java and javaScript
