# Python More Classes

Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object oriented programming. A class creates a new type where objects are instances of the class. An analogy is that you can have variables of type int which translates to saying that variables that store integers are variables which are instances (objects) of the int class.

In this module or task we shall cover more concepts on classes and objects including but not limited, classmethods, inheritance and many more.
