# 0x0A-PYTHON-inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism in programming that allows classes inherit attributes and methods from other classes. Just like we inherit behaviours from our relatives/ancestors, programming languages like Python also supports inherits. This avoids DRY (Do'nt Repeat Yourself) and also helps make our code reusable and clean. When a class inherits, it inherits everything including the private methods or attributes from its parent. However python is abit different that it as well supports multiple inheritance.
